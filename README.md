In this series of projects, I embarked on an exciting journey with a triplog dataset, which contained latitude and longitude data collected over a 3-day trip. Through a series of projects, I showcased my expertise in manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing GPS data. Let's take a closer look at the progression of these projects and the key accomplishments:

First, I tackled the initial project, where I successfully converted a GPX file, named "triplog.gpx," into a more accessible CSV file format called "triplog.csv." This conversion was a crucial step that allowed for easier handling and manipulation of the data in subsequent projects. By implementing the Convert.java class, I skillfully extracted the latitude and longitude data from the GPX file and seamlessly stored it in the CSV format.

Building upon this foundation, I dived into Project 2, where I delved deeper into the triplog dataset stored in "triplog.csv." With the implementation of the TripPoint.java class, I demonstrated my ability to extract meaningful metrics from the data. This involved calculating essential trip statistics, such as the total distance covered during the journey and the average speed. By meticulously analyzing the dataset and utilizing well-crafted methods, I successfully derived valuable insights into the trip data.

Project 3 presented an exciting challenge where I refined the triplog dataset by identifying and removing excess points, commonly known as "stops." By skillfully examining the data, I accurately pinpointed these stop points and expertly eliminated them from the dataset. This data refinement process greatly enhanced the accuracy of the trip analysis, enabling more precise calculations of total time and average speed by excluding the time spent at stops.

The culmination of my efforts was showcased in the final project, Project 5, where I developed a visually engaging graphical user interface (GUI) for visualizing the triplog dataset on a map. Through meticulous coding and creative design, I successfully plotted the trip points on the map, enabling users to vividly experience the journey. To further enhance the user experience, I incorporated a captivating animation feature that displayed the path taken during the trip. Leveraging the provided TripPoint class, I crafted a unique and intuitive GUI, delivering a seamless and interactive visualization of the triplog data.

By completing this comprehensive series of projects, I demonstrated my proficiency in working with triplog data and GPS datasets. Throughout the projects, I showcased my ability to convert file formats, extract valuable information, refine datasets, and create visually captivating and user-friendly interfaces. The final code and projects serve as a testament to my skills in handling and analyzing GPS data, making them valuable additions to my portfolio.
